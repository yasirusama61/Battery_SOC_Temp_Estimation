AI Battery Management System (AI BMS)
Overview
The AI Battery Management System (AI BMS) is an advanced solution designed for real-time monitoring, state prediction, and optimization of battery performance. This system uses machine learning models to estimate key parameters like SOC (State of Charge), SOH (State of Health), and temperature. It also integrates with edge platforms to enable fast data processing and supports remote learning through OTA (Over-The-Air) updates.

The AI BMS is designed for high-efficiency management of battery packs, including thermal management, safety controls, and performance optimization. Its features aim to extend the lifecycle of battery systems, improve operational efficiency, and enhance the safety of electric vehicles or other energy storage applications.

Features
High-Precision SOC Estimation: Accurate state of charge predictions to prevent unexpected power outages.
SOH, SOE, and SOI Estimation: Machine learning-based predictions for health, energy, and imbalance.
Temperature Prediction: Real-time estimation of battery temperature to prevent overheating.
Immersion-Cooled Pack Management: Integrated with cooling systems to ensure stable and safe operation.
Remote Learning and OTA Updates: Use ECM models for continuous improvement of battery performance via over-the-air parameter updates.
Optimization of Charging Algorithms: Algorithms to optimize charging cycles for longevity and performance.
Edge and Cloud Integration: Seamlessly integrates with edge platforms for low-latency operations and cloud platforms for advanced simulations and monitoring.

Data Setup
Downloading Data: The dataset can be obtained from AWS Timestream. Sample CSV files are provided in the /data folder for quick setup.
Preprocessing: Use the scripts in /scripts to preprocess the data before model training or evaluation.
Running the Models
Training: To train the SOC, SOH, and temperature prediction models, run the following command:

bash
Copy code
python scripts/train_model.py --model soc --data_path data/your_dataset.csv
Inference: After training, you can run inference using:

bash
Copy code
python scripts/inference.py --model soc --input_path data/your_input_data.csv
Visualizations: Notebooks for visualizing predictions and model performance are available in the /notebooks directory.

AWS Integration
The system is integrated with AWS services like Timestream and SageMaker for model deployment and data storage. The boto3 library is used for querying Timestream data.

Make sure your AWS credentials are configured using:

bash
Copy code
aws configure
Usage Examples
SOC Prediction
To predict the state of charge (SOC) of a battery pack, use the pre-trained SOC model as follows:

bash
Copy code
python scripts/inference.py --model soc --input_path data/test_data.csv
Temperature Estimation
To estimate the temperature of battery cells based on real-time voltage, current, and environmental temperature data:

bash
Copy code
python scripts/inference.py --model temp --input_path data/temperature_data.csv
Edge and Cloud Deployment
The AI BMS supports deployment on edge platforms like NXP MCUs and cloud platforms like AWS SageMaker. The OTA update feature allows for remote learning and parameter adjustments to continuously optimize performance.
